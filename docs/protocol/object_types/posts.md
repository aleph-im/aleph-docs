# Posts

Posts are unique data entries, that can be amended later on, like blog
posts, comments, events... Internally, POST messages are similar to
STORE messages but differ in that they support amending and only support
JSON content.

## Content format

The `content` field of a POST message must contain the
following fields:

- `address [str]`: The address to which the aggregate belongs. Reserved for future developments.
- `time [float]`: The epoch timestamp of the message.
- `content [Dict]`: The JSON content of the post.
- `ref [Optional[str]]`: Used for amending. If specified, must be set to the item hash of 
  the original message that created the post to modify.
- `type [str]`: User-defined content type.

## Amend posts

Users can amend posts by sending additional POST messages referencing the original message. 
To do so, the user must send a new POST message with the content `ref` field set to the item hash of the
original POST message and set the post `type` field to `amend`. 
Note that even if the user amends the message multiple times, the `ref` field must always 
reference the original message, not the amendments. 
Amendments are applied in the order of the content `time` field.

## Retrieve posts

Users can retrieve posts by using the `/api/v1/posts.json` endpoint.

> `/api/v0/posts.json` is deprecated.
