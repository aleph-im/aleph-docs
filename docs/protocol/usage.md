## Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### 1. Setting Up Your Wallet
- **Requirements**: You need a digital wallet that supports one of the chains Aleph.im operates with. Make sure your wallet is funded with enough $ALEPH or other supported cryptocurrencies to cover your resource usage.
- **Supported Chains**: Aleph.im supports multiple chains, ensuring flexibility depending on your wallet and preferred blockchain.

### 2. Acquiring $ALEPH
- **Purchasing $ALEPH**: You can acquire $ALEPH tokens on various exchanges or through decentralized exchange platforms like Uniswap, Trader Joe, and Jupiter on Solana.
- **Exchanges**: Check the availability of $ALEPH on popular exchanges and choose based on your location and convenience.

### 3. Accessing twentrysix.cloud
- **Web Console**: twentrysix.cloud serves as the web console for deploying and managing your projects on Aleph.im. It offers an intuitive user interface to interact with the decentralized resources efficiently.
- **Deployment**: Log in to twentrysix.cloud using your wallet. This platform will guide you through setting up and deploying your projects.

### 4. Deploying New Projects
- **Configuration**: Through twentrysix.cloud, configure the required resources for your project, such as compute power and storage needs.
- **Deployment**: Follow the on-screen instructions to deploy your applications or storage setups.

## Understanding the Costs

### Resource Costs
- **Pay-as-You-Go**: Aleph.im operates on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for the resources you consume.
- **Resource Metering**: Costs are calculated based on the amount of computing power and storage you use, metered to the millisecond.

### Fee Structure
- **Distribution**: When you pay for resources, 80% of the payment goes directly to the Compute Resource Node (CRN) operator, and 20% is allocated as a network fee to support the ongoing development and incentivization of node operators.
- **Example**: If you pay $100 in $ALEPH for computing resources, $80 will go to the CRN operator and $20 to the Aleph.im network.

### Wallet Transactions
- **Transactions**: All transactions and interactions on twentrysix.cloud require a compatible wallet connected and enough $ALEPH to complete the transactions.
- **Gas Fees**: Be aware of potential blockchain network fees (gas fees) that apply to transactions on the blockchain you are using.

## Conclusion
Aleph.im provides a robust platform for decentralized applications, leveraging blockchain technology to offer secure and scalable compute and storage solutions. By following this guide, you can start utilizing Aleph.im for your projects with a clear understanding of the operational procedures and cost implications. Remember, the decentralized nature of Aleph.im not only enhances security and flexibility but also promotes a more open and interoperable digital ecosystem.
