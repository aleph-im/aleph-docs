# Troubleshooting node score and rewards

## Optimizing the score of a node

### 1. Ensure that your node is up-to-date:

A well performing node must be up-to-date. This includes:

- Running the latest version of the node software.
- All system updates installed.

New versions of the node software are announced on the [Node operators Telegram Channel](https://t.me/alephim/123724)
as well as on the GitHub repositories:

- [https://github.com/aleph-im/pyaleph/releases](https://github.com/aleph-im/pyaleph/releases) for Core Channel Nodes
- [https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-vm/releases](https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-vm/releases) for Compute Resource Nodes

The installation of system updates can be automated using 
[Unattended Upgrades](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades).

### 2. Ensure that the node uses performant hardware

Ensure that the CPU, RAM, storage and network connectivity are fast enough.

### 3. Decentralize the network

While the decentralization of the network does not affect the reliability and performance score
of nodes directly, it has a big effect when computing the rewards.

See the [rewards](rewards.md) page for more info.
