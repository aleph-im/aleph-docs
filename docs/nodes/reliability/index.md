# Node Reliability

The Aleph.im network is a decentralized network of nodes operated by a multitude of different entities. 

The reliability and performance of the nodes are essential for the network to function correctly.
While the network as a whole is designed to be resilient to failures, the reliability and performance of individual
nodes can vary.

The reliability and performance of the nodes in the aleph.im network are based on the following principles:

1. [Metrics](./metrics.md) are measurements of the performance and reliability of the nodes.
2. [Scores](./scores.md) interpret the metrics as a few global indicators.
3. [Rewards](./rewards.md) use the scores to incentivize the community to provide efficient nodes.

We highly recommend [monitoring the performance and reliability](monitoring.md) of your nodes to ensure they are operating correctly.
