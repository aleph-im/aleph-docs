# Node Reliability

Aleph.im is a decentralized cloud platform that operates through a network of independent servers, or nodes, which offer 
cloud computing resources to its users. 

To ensure high-quality service, it's crucial that active nodes perform reliably, undergo regular updates and maintenance,
and maintain optimal uptime.

The reliability and performance of the nodes are based on the following principles:

1. [Metrics](./metrics.md) are measurements of the performance and reliability of the nodes.
2. [Scores](./scores.md) interpret the metrics as a few global indicators.
3. [Rewards](./rewards.md) use the scores to incentivize the community to provide efficient nodes.

We highly recommend [monitoring the performance and reliability](monitoring.md) of your nodes to ensure they are operating correctly.
