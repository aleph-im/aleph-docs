# Node Reliability

The reliability and performance of the nodes in the aleph.im network are based on the following principles:

1. [Metrics](./metrics.md) are measurements of the performance and reliability of the nodes.
2. [Scores](./scores.md) interpret the metrics as a few global indicators.
3. [Rewards](./rewards.md) use the scores to incentivize the community to provide efficient nodes.
