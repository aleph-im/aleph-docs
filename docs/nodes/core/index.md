# Core Channel Nodes

## Introduction

Aleph.im Core Channel Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of the aleph.im decentralized network, which provides a
secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant platform for various types of data storage and messaging services. The
core channel nodes are responsible for maintaining the integrity, security, and reliability of the network by processing
and validating transactions, storing and sharing data, and ensuring consensus among the participating nodes.

These nodes are crucial for the seamless operation of aleph.im as they enable various functionalities, such as
cross-chain communication, data storage, and data indexing. They facilitate the exchange of information between
different blockchain networks and allow developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the power
of aleph.im.

The core channel nodes are designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, ensuring that the aleph.im network remains
operational even in the face of adversarial conditions or network failures. They are governed by a set of protocols and
consensus algorithms that incentivize honest behavior and discourage malicious actions.

Moreover, aleph.im core channel nodes are operated by a diverse set of participants, including individuals,
organizations, and developers, which helps ensure the decentralization and security of the network. To become a compute
resource node, participants need to stake ALEPH tokens, which serve as a form of collateral to
ensure that the node operators remain honest and provide reliable services. Node operators are
rewarded with ALEPH tokens for their contribution to the network, which further motivates them to maintain
