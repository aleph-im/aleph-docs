# Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa (Deprecated)

Support for Ubuntu 20.04 was due to compatibility issues with
the NFTables firewall introduced in version
[0.2.6](https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-vm/releases/tag/0.2.6).

We recommend upgrading to the latest Ubuntu version
and then use the
[following instructions on Ubuntu 24.04](./ubuntu-24.04.md).
