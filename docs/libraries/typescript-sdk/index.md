# Introduction

Similar to the [Python SDK](../python-sdk/index.md), the TypeScript SDK provides a set of tools to interact with the Aleph.im network.

Since the release of the newly refactored [Aleph TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-sdk-ts), the original [aleph-ts-sdk](https://npmjs.com/package/aleph-ts-sdk) has been deprecated and split into smaller, more manageable packages.

These documentations refer to the [v1.0.0-alpha1 release](https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-sdk-ts/releases/tag/v1.0.0-a1).
## Installation

The Aleph.im TypeScript SDK is available on NPM, and can be installed using `npm`:

```shell
npm install @aleph-sdk/client
```

## Usage

- [Creating an account](accounts.md)
- [Sending & reading POST messages](posts.md)
- [Sending & reading AGGREGATE messages](aggregates.md)
