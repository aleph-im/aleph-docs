## Delegate write access to an aggregate key

In certain contexts, you may want to allow another account to update your aggregate. </br>
This can be done by creating a [security key](./security_key.md)

### Usage

Then [create a security key](./security_key.md) for the account you want to delegate write access to. </br>
After that, you will be able to delegate write access to another account.
