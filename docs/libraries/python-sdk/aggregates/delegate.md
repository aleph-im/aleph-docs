In certain contexts, you may want to allow another account to update your aggregate. </br>
This can be done by with the security key

!!! note
    This section will give an example of how to create a security key.
    <br>More information about the security key in the [permissions section](../../../protocol/permissions.md#the-security-aggregate).

## Create a security key

```python
from aleph.sdk.chains.ethereum import get_fallback_account
from aleph.sdk.client import AuthenticatedAlephHttpClient

TARGET_ADDRESS = ...  # Put the target address here
assert TARGET_ADDRESS is not ..., "The target address was not specified"

async def main(target_address: str):
    account = get_fallback_account()
    async with AuthenticatedAlephHttpClient(account) as client:
        message, status = await client.create_aggregate(
            "security",
            {
                "authorizations": [
                    {
                        "address": target_address,
                    }
                ]
            },
            sync=True,
        )
        return message, status
import asyncio
message, status = asyncio.run(main(TARGET_ADDRESS))
```

> Don't forget to replace `TARGET_ADDRESS` with the address you want to delegate to.

At this moment, `TARGET_ADDRESS` should be able to update your aggregate by using [create_aggregate](./create.md) with the delegated account.

You can verify this by fetching the security aggregate:

```python
from aleph.sdk.client import AlephHttpClient
import asyncio

MY_ADDRESS = ...  # Put your address here.
assert MY_ADDRESS is not ..., "The address was not specified"

async def main(my_address: str):
    async with AlephHttpClient() as client:
        aggregate = await client.fetch_aggregate(
            my_address,
            "security"
        )
        return aggregate

aggregate = asyncio.run(main(MY_ADDRESS))
print(aggregate)
```

outputs:

```
{"authorizations": [{"address": "TARGET_ADDRESS"}]}

```

`AggregateMessage.content.address` tracks who posted this change to your aggregate.
This way you can audit the trail of changes to the aggregate.
