# Overview

## What is Aleph?

Aleph is an open-source off-chain P2P (peer-to-peer) network featuring a decentralized database (inc. file storage),
computing, and a DID framework. Aleph allows your blockchain-enabled app (dApp) to securely access trusted off-chain
data or computation through cross-chain connectivity and our client libraries.
