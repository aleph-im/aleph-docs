# Write Your Code Documentation

If you prefer coding directly on our platform, this guide is for you. Our integrated development environment (IDE) provides a seamless experience for writing, testing, and deploying your code. Here's how you can get started with writing your code directly on our platform.

## Getting Started with the IDE

Our IDE offers a user-friendly interface, designed to accommodate both novice and experienced developers. Hereâ€™s how you can initiate the coding process:

### Select Your Language

Initially, select the programming language for your project. Our platform currently supports the following languages:

- Python
- Node.js
- Other (please refer to our documentation for additional languages)

## Writing Your Code

To ensure seamless execution and interaction with our platform, your code must include an `app` function, which serves as the entry point.

### The `app` Function

- **Python**: In Python, your `app` function should be defined in any of the files, acting as the entry point of your application.
  
  ```python
  def app():
      # Your Python code here
  ```
  
  For detailed Python-specific guidelines, please see [Python Documentation](../languages/python/index.html).

- **Node.js**: In Node.js, define an `app` function in your main file. This function will be invoked to start your application.
  
  ```javascript
  function app() {
      // Your Node.js code here
  }
  ```
  
  Refer to [Node.js Documentation](../languages/nodejs/index.html) for more on Node.js best practices.

- **Other**: For languages other than Python and Node.js, ensure to define an equivalent entry function or method that complies with the execution standards of the respective language.
  
  Consult [Other Languages Documentation](../languages/other/index.html) for specifics on other supported languages.

## Uploading and Executing Your Code

After writing your code in the IDE:

1. **Review and Test**: Ensure your code runs correctly within the IDE.
2. **Upload**: Follow the platform-specific instructions to upload your code.
3. **Execute**: Once uploaded, your code can be executed directly on our platform.
