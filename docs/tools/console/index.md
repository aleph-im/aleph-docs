## Uploading Code: Two Convenient Modes

When it comes to integrating your code with our platform, there are two flexible options tailored to meet unique needs. Whether looking to quickly upload a project or preferring to manually input code via the user interface, the platform supports both. Here is a closer look at these methods to determine which best aligns with your workflow.

### File Upload

For projects that are packaged and ready, the file upload method is the straightforward choice. It's efficient and ideal for uploading an entire project in a few simple steps. For detailed instructions on preparing and uploading your file, please visit the [File Upload Guide](./upload.md).

### Direct Code Input

For those who favor a more hands-on approach or need to make incremental updates, inputting code directly through the user interface is the alternative method. This option allows for real-time coding and adjustments within the platform. For more information on utilizing this feature, consult the [Direct Code Input Page](./write_your_code.md).
