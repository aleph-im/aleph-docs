## Uploading Code: Two Convenient Modes

Integrating code with the platform offers two flexible options to accommodate different preferences. Whether the goal is to rapidly upload a complete project or to input code manually through the user interface, both methods are supported. Each approach has its benefits, depending on the workflow and requirements.

### File Upload

For projects that are packaged and ready, the file upload method is the straightforward choice. It's efficient and ideal for uploading an entire project in a few simple steps. For detailed instructions on preparing and uploading your file, please visit the [File Upload Guide](./upload.md).

### Direct Code Input

For those who favor a more hands-on approach or need to make incremental updates, inputting code directly through the user interface is the alternative method. This option allows for real-time coding and adjustments within the platform. For more information on utilizing this feature, consult the [Direct Code Input Page](./write_your_code.md).
