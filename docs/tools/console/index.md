## Uploading Code: Two Convenient Modes

When it comes to integrating your code with our platform, we provide you with two flexible options tailored to meet your unique needs. Whether you're looking to quickly upload a project or prefer to manually input your code via our user interface, we've got you covered. Let's explore these two methods to find out which one best suits your workflow.

### File Upload

If you've got your project packaged and ready, the file upload method is your go-to option. It's quick, straightforward, and perfect for getting your entire project uploaded in a few simple steps. For detailed instructions on preparing and uploading your file, please visit our [File Upload Guide](./upload.md).

### Direct Code Input

For those who prefer a more hands-on approach or have incremental updates, writing your code directly through our user interface might be the preferred method. This option allows for real-time coding and adjustments within our platform. For more information on how to use this feature, check out our [Direct Code Input Page](./write_your_code.md).
