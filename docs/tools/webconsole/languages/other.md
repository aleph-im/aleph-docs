### Selecting Your Language

For the "Other" section, let's consider a Rust program. Ensure the project is developed in Rust.

Here is an example [Rust Sample](https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-vm/tree/main/examples/example_http_rust)

### Structuring Your Project

A typical structure for a Rust project ready for packaging might look like this:

```plaintext
my_rust_project/
│
├── src/
│   └── main.rs  # Your main application file.
├── Cargo.toml  # Describes your project and its dependencies.
├── Cargo.lock  # Ensures consistent builds.
```

1. **Main File**: The main Rust file, main.rs, should reside in the src directory, serving as the application's entry point.
2. **Dependencies**: The `Cargo.toml` file at the root lists all project dependencies. Defining `Cargo.toml` and executing cargo build generates a target directory and `Cargo.lock`, assuring build consistency.
3. **Compilation**: Use `cargo build --release` to compile the project, creating an executable in `target/release`. For upload, include only the executable, excluding the entire `target` directory.

### Defining the Entry Point

The entry point for Rust projects is the `main` function in `src/main.rs`.

### Example Code

Your Rust application might look like this:

```rust
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::net::TcpListener;
use std::net::TcpStream;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").unwrap();
    println!("Running on 0.0.0.0:8080");
    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();
        handle_connection(stream);
    }
}

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    println!("handling connection");

    const MSG: &str = "helloworld";
    let response = format!("{:x?}", MSG.as_bytes());

    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
    stream.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();

    let response = format!("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nOKIDOK\n{}", response);
    stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    stream.flush().unwrap();
}
```

### Uploading Your Code

To deploy your Rust application on the platform:

1. **Navigate to Code Upload**: Access the code upload section by creating a new function.
2. **Choose File**: Select your packaged file containing the compiled binary.
3. **Select Language**: Choose Rust as the language.
4. **Specify Entry Point**: The entry point is defined in your `Cargo.toml` and implemented in `src/main.rs`. 
5. **Upload**: Submit your package for processing.
