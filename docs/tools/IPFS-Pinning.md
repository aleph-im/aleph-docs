# Aleph.im's Unique Feature: Decentralized IPFS Pinning

Aleph.im, a **decentralized cloud solution** built for cross-blockchain applications, boasts a unique capability: **decentralized InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) pinning**. This feature amplifies the platform's data storage and sharing potential, emphasizing Aleph.im's dedication to full decentralization and resistance to censorship.

## Demystifying IPFS Pinning

Comprehending this feature requires an understanding of IPFS pinning. The InterPlanetary File System, or IPFS, is a distributed file system structured to unify all computing devices with a common system of files. Similar to BitTorrent, IPFS enables users to host and retrieve data.

"**Pinning**" within IPFS is a function that maintains the persistent storage of data on a particular node, ensuring its ongoing availability. In the absence of pinning, data might be displaced or lost from the network as fresh data populates the cache. Thus, pinning is a critical operation for safeguarding data within the IPFS network.

## The Drawbacks of Centralized Pinning

A majority of IPFS pinning solutions lean towards a centralized model, depending on a single node or service for data storage. This approach, however, harbors inherent risks as data could be compromised if the specific node experiences any disruptions.

## Aleph.im's Approach to Decentralized IPFS Pinning

Aleph.im diverges from this model, offering a decentralized take on IPFS pinning. Rather than confining pinned data to a single node, Aleph.im disseminates the data across multiple nodes within its network.

This decentralized pinning strategy bolsters data redundancy and resilience. It makes the network more impervious to single points of failure as the data continues to be accessible even if a node fails or goes offline.

## Decentralized IPFS Pinning Reflecting Aleph.im's Vision

This innovative approach to decentralized pinning is a testament to Aleph.im's broader vision of absolute decentralization. It provides users with enhanced control over their data while simultaneously improving data availability and security.
