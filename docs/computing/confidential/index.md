# Confidential computing

Aleph.im supports confidential virtual machines in beta, securised with AMD SEV. This is also known as TEE, Trusted Execution Environment.

Both the memory (RAM) and the disk are fully encrypted by the CPU, such that no one can see what happens in a virtual machine from the outside.
