### Selecting Your Language

Concerning Other section let's try with Rust program. Confirm that your project is developed in Rust.

Here is an example [Rust Sample](https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-vm/tree/main/examples/example_http_rust)

### Create the `run.sh` Script (Optionnal)

Even though Rust applications compile to a binary, you can still use a `run.sh` script to execute the binary within the correct environment. The script should look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

set -euf

cd /opt/code
./your_executable_name
```

Replace `your_executable_name` with the name of the binary produced by compiling your Rust project.

### Structuring Your Project

Here’s a sample structure for a Rust project ready for packaging:

```plaintext
my_rust_project/
│
├── src/
│   └── main.rs  # Your main application file.
├── Cargo.toml  # Describes your project and its dependencies.
├── Cargo.lock  # Ensures consistent builds.
└── run.sh
```

1. **Main File**: Place your main Rust file, such as `main.rs`, inside the `src` directory. This file is the entry point to your application.
2. **Dependencies**: Include a `Cargo.toml` file in your project root. This file should list all dependencies needed for your project. After defining your `Cargo.toml`, running `cargo build` will generate a `target` directory and a `Cargo.lock` file, ensuring consistent builds.
3. **Compilation**: Compile your project using `cargo build --release` to generate the executable in the `target/release` directory. For uploading, you only need the executable file, not the entire `target` directory.

### Defining the Entry Point

For Rust projects, the entry point is the `main` function in the `src/main.rs` file.

### Example Code

Your Rust application might look like this:

```rust
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::net::TcpListener;
use std::net::TcpStream;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").unwrap();
    println!("Running on 0.0.0.0:8080");
    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        let stream = stream.unwrap();
        handle_connection(stream);
    }
}

fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    println!("handling connection");

    const MSG: &str = "helloworld";
    let response = format!("{:x?}", MSG.as_bytes());

    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
    stream.read(&mut buffer).unwrap();

    let response = format!("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nOKIDOK\n{}", response);
    stream.write(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
    stream.flush().unwrap();
}
```

### Uploading Your Code

To upload your Rust application to the platform, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Code Upload**: Access the code upload section by creating a new function.
2. **Choose File**: Select your packaged file containing the compiled binary and `run.sh` script.
3. **Select Language**: Choose Rust as the language.
4. **Specify Entry Point**: The entry point is defined in your `Cargo.toml` and implemented in `src/main.rs`. Ensure your Rust binary is correctly referenced in `run.sh`.
5. **Upload**: Submit your package for processing.

By following these steps, your Rust application will be correctly packaged and configured for deployment on the platform.
