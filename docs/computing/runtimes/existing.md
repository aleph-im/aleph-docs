# Existing Runtimes

### Official runtime with Debian 11, Python 3.9 and NodeJS 14

Aleph.im provides users with a default runtime based on [Debian 11 "bullseye"](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBullseye),
the current stable version of the Debian project which can
be [found on the Explorer](https://explorer.aleph.im/address/ETH/0x101d8D16372dBf5f1614adaE95Ee5CCE61998Fc9/message/STORE/bd79839bf96e595a06da5ac0b6ba51dea6f7e2591bb913deccded04d831d29f4).
This runtime is built with software available in the distribution, including Python 3.9 and Nodejs 14.

To optimize performance, this runtime uses a custom [Linux init](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init) process. This
process is specially designed to quickly launch the right endpoint in response to events such as HTTP requests. This is
especially useful when using [on-demand execution](../index.md#on-demand-execution).
