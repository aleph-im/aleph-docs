## Install from source

```

## Run the development server
By running the following command, you will get a server that will automatically update the docs pages whenever you edit the sources.
```shell
pipenv run mkdocs serve
```

## JSON schemas

Using a Jetbrain IDE, you can manage loading JSON schemas using the Languages & Frameworks | Schemas and DTDs | Remote
JSON Schemas page of the Settings/Preferences dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S).
